 What is Butylated Hydroxytoluene (BHT)?
Butylated Hydroxytoluene, commonly known as BHT, is a synthetic antioxidant used primarily to prevent the oxidation of fats and oils in food products. Its chemical properties make it a valuable additive in preserving the freshness and extending the shelf life of various goods. Beyond the food industry, BHT is also utilized in cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and even plastics, demonstrating its versatility and importance across sectors.
The Importance of BHT in Food Preservation
In the food industry, BHT plays a crucial role in preventing rancidity. By inhibiting the oxidation process, it helps maintain the quality and safety of products such as baked goods, snack foods, and processed meats. This is particularly important in today’s fast-paced market, where consumers demand convenience without compromising on quality.
 BHT in Cosmetics and Personal Care Products
